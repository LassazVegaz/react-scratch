# Bulidng React from Scratch

Building basic parts of [React UI library](https://reactjs.org/) from scratch to see how this amazing little library works.

It is recommended to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) in this project.

1. Fork and clone the project
2. Install the dependencies: `yarn`
3. Run app for development: `yarn dev`
4. Open the browser and navigate to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/)

## ToDo

1. ~~Support HTML elements~~
2. ~~Support custom components~~
3. Support stateful components
    - ~~useState to store state~~
    - ~~useState for multiple states~~
    - more reliable way to bound states to components
