# Bulidng React from Scratch

I am building basic parts of React from scratch to see how this amazing little library works.

It is recommended to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) in this project.

1. Fork and clone the project
2. Install the dependencies: `yarn`
3. Run app: `yarn start` or `yarn run dev`
4. Open the browser and navigate to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/)
